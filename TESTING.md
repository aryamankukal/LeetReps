### Test 13: Multiple Submissions
1. **Solve Same Problem**: Submit the same problem multiple times
2. **Verify Updates**: Solve count should increase, last solved time should update

### Test 14: Browser Restart
1. **Restart Chrome**: Close and reopen Chrome
2. **Check Persistence**: Your saved problems should still be there
3. **Verify Badge**: Badge count should be correct

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Extension Not Loading
